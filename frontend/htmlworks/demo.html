    <em>Twenty-six Chinooks have entered Australian service, comprising twelve
        CH-47C variants, four CH-47Ds and ten CH-47Fs. They have been operated by both the Royal Australian Air Force
        (RAAF)
        and the Australian Army. Twelve CH-47C Chinooks were ordered in 1970 and entered service with the RAAF in 1974.

        eleven surviving Chinooks were retired in 1989

<!--       helicopters could not replace their capabilities, so four were upgraded to CH-47D standard, and-->
        returned to service with the army in 1995. The army acquired two more CH-47Ds in 2000 and another pair in 2012.
        The
        CH-47Ds were replaced</em>
